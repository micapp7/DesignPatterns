The Factory Method Pattern
- defines an interface for creating a SINGLE object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- lets a class defer instantiation to its subclass
- Any other methods implemented in the abstract Creator are written to operate on products produced by the factory method.

Dependency Inversion Principle
-Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

Abstract Factory
- provides an interface for creating a FAMILY of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
- provides an interface for a family of products (New York, Chicago).
- Provides implementations for products (ingredients).
- concrete subclasses produce the same products with different implementations.
- allows client code to remain the same.

Benefit
- Encapsulate object creation to keep applications loosely couped and less dependent on implementations.
